## Technology Stack

- **Looker Studio**: For creating the interactive dashboard and visual reports.
- **AppSheet**: For building the mobile and web application interface and handling data management.
- **Google Sheets**: Stores employee attendance records, payroll data, and advance payments, serving as the backend for the AppSheet app.

---

## How It Works

1. **Attendance Tracking**: Employees' check-in and check-out times are recorded in real-time. The system calculates total hours worked each day and logs this data into a Google Sheets database.
   
2. **Payroll Calculation**: Based on hourly rates and total hours worked, the system calculates monthly earnings. If an employee has taken an advance, itâ€™s deducted from their monthly pay, and net pay is computed.

3. **Real-Time Dashboard**: The Looker Studio dashboard aggregates and displays data, allowing managers to view monthly attendance statistics, payroll summaries, and advance payments. Filters are available for month, location, and department to provide specific insights.

4. **Advance Payment Management**: The app manages advance payments taken by employees and adjusts them in the payroll calculations to reflect accurate net pay.

## Usage

1. **Log Attendance**: Employees log their in-time and out-time daily. The app automatically updates the total working hours.

2. **Payroll Processing**: At the end of each month, the app calculates each employee's total earnings, deducts any advances, and provides a net pay amount.

3. **View Dashboard**: Managers can view attendance summaries, total earnings, advances, and net pay in the Looker Studio dashboard.
